Lesson Setup
============

As we will be using `make` as a tool for creating data pipelines, we should start 
by creating some data input files.

We will be generating CSV files from statistics on your computer. The end result 
will be that everyone in the room will have a slightly different set of statistics.

To begin, open the shell and install the `psutil` module. It is a cross-portable
way of gathering system statistics.

    pip install psutil
